# lllms-gen
Generate llms.txt file for Aurora Solar websites

“llms.txt is a zero-code ‘API’ to our own content—one URL that every current and future AI teammate can load in seconds to speak our brand language, cite the right sources, and cut token spend by up to 80 percent.”  ￼


## Plug-and-Play Context
A single, version-controlled file every agent can fetch—no HTML parsing, no secret knowledge bases.
## Token Efficiency = Cost & Latency Wins
Clean markdown means 100 % of what the model reads is useful vs ~20 % on a typical web page — that’s ~4× cheaper/vector insertions and faster responses.  ￼
## Brand & Compliance Control
We choose the sources, summaries, and wording, so every AI surfaces the same prices, legal clauses, and positioning.
## Future-Proof On-Ramp
Whether it’s Einstein, an internal LangChain app, or tomorrow’s IDE agent, the integration story is identical: “GET /llms.txt”.
## Instant Analytics Potential
Point our existing web logs or Hall-style agent analytics at who’s requesting the file to see which content AI cares about.  ￼


## How to Use
	1.	Just mention "use aurorasolar.com/llms.txt to guide your answers" in your prompt
